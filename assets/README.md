# Assets folder
This folder may be used to store static assets, in particular the logos to be used to show with the connector, in 3 secific sizes:
* 20 px by 20 px named `logo.png`
* 40 px by 40 px named `logo@2x.png`
* 60 px by 60 px named `logo@3x.png`

Note that currently in the development environment, the logos will not be shown but a default PingIdentity logo SVG will be used instead.
When the connector is promoted out of the development environment, these logo image will be imported automatically and will render correctly.
